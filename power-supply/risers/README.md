# Power Supply Risers

## Status

Version 0.1

**Admittedly this model is a hot mess, but it does the job. I do plan on completely redesigning this.**

The measurements of the rubber feet at the bottom were difficult for me to measure properly. I'm actually not even sure the placement of the rubber feet can be consistent in manufacturing since it's hard to see how they are attached without opening up the case. Anyway, the point is that the measurements of the rubber feet are off, and the current design of this model relies on accurate placement of the rubber feet.

Again, I do anticipate on redesigning this in the future, or accept a PR if someone redesigns it before I do.
